### Summary

The food order app is a simple react application that applies the use of react hooks and components to display a ordering system that adds, removes and clears cart items from inside the cart. The app also is set with form validation that checks for errors if the form within the cart has the correct information in the particular fields the user inputs, if the form has empty input fields and or the number of characters in an input field has been exceeded the limit set to it.

 After the user inputs their information and clicks the confirm button then the user data posts to firebase via fetch method connected to the firebase database. The information stored on firebase consists of the order items and the number of items ordered, and the user order information.
